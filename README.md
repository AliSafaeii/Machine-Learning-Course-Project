In this project, I have used six different Convolutional Neural Networks models for the binary image classification of muffins and chihuahuas images. The performance of different models with different number of convolutional layers have been analysed. Also, the effect of using dropout technique and data augmentation technique on the performance of a model have been investigated. Furthermore, I performed a hyperparameter tuning process for a model to obtain the best combination of hyperparameters to improve the performance of that model. Additionally, to apply a transfer learning approach, a pre-trained VGG16 model has been used to build a model in this project. Finally, I used 5-fold cross validation method to evaluate the performance of the highest performing model. According to the results, the highest performing model in this project has 98.23% accuracy on the test set, and 97.46% average validation accuracy obtained from 5-fold cross validation method.
